                    If my mother isn't anything else she is most definitely a business woman, and she is the best at what does. There are so many things that I easily overlook that my mom just autimatcally knows. I hope to one day be able to take care of business just as well a she does.

                    This is the best and most important trait of them all. I thank both you and my father for raising me in a place filled with the lord and teaching me enough to continue my own faith in my older years as a teen and now an adult. You are always in some type of ministry at our church or at some type of event at another. I pray that you always stay this way no matter what and remember that God is on your side always.
